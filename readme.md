### [Minimum Spanning Tree Script](https://github.com/imesut/OR-Scripts/tree/master/minimum_spanning_tree)

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.[[*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)]
